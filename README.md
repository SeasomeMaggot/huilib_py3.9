huilib (Houdini UI Library)
=========

Python library for building native houdini user interfaces.

Houdini doesn't have a native python ui lib. 
This library is a simple Python wrapper around Houdini .ui scripting language. Although it doesn't cover even a half of all available houdini UI controlls, it does provide most usefull of them, such as buttons, textFields, checkboxes, menus, etc.
The coding style is very similar to PyQt.

It was written for fun.Hope someone finds it usefull.
